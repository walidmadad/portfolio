                <p className="mb-6 text-lg md:text-xl font-light max-w-2xl">
                    Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack developer in my third year of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Licence Informatique) with a focus on creating innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and address real-world challenges. My journey in tech has equipped me with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to build seamless, responsive, and efficient applications.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg md:text-xl font-light max-w-2xl">
                    With a diverse skill set in programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript, I have extensive experience in web development, where I have designed and implemented projects that prioritize user experience, accessibility, and maintainability. I am proficient in both the client and server sides of web applications, working with frameworks like React and Laravel to create robust, scalable solutions.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg md:text-xl font-light max-w-2xl">
                    Beyond technical skills, I am a firm believer in clean code and optimized algorithms, valuing software that is both functional and easy to maintain. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others, contribute to shared goals, and continuously push the boundaries of my skills.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg md:text-xl font-light max-w-2xl">
                    Currently, I am actively exploring the latest trends in web technologies, focusing on cloud integration, and refining my knowledge of full-stack frameworks. I am eager to take on challenging projects that leverage my background and drive for continual improvement in this ever-evolving field.
